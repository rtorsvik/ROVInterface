	Terje's To Do:

- Make the loader ignore parts of the xml instead of failing all of it, such as skipping only joystick settings if the only error is in that.
- Make the loader and saver work around graphics settings.
- Implement DataHolder Clear() function.
- Fix positioning of the warning icons from the pivot and to the right or center.
- Make sure the icons don't get drawn outside of the graphic window.
	- test if anything can be drawn outside of the graphic window or if its giving an error
- Make sure the overdrawing don't try to get something of the image/bitmap outside of bounds
- Fix the overdrawing when no image has been loaded, or failed to load.
