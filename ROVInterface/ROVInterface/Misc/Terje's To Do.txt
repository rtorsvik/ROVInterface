	Terje's To Do:

- Implement DataHolder Clear() function.
- Fix positioning of the warning icons from the pivot and to the right or center.
- Make sure the icons don't get drawn outside of the graphic window.
- Implement digits in indexStats, and wherever else it should be used, where it will always show the x amount of digits, like 10.00
