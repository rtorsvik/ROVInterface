	Terje's To Do:

- Make the ST_Register tick delay be reduced to max framerate, instead of adding it. 10 ms per tick shouldn't be 10 ms + send time, but rather minimum 10 ms including the send time.
- Add a check to actually delete the control in GraphicToolbox.
- Make the toolbox Sliders have a label with its name and its current value, and its value while moving the slider.
x Add graphics.xml to settings.xml
	- Make everything able to change in the software, including warning values.
- Make the FindNextAfterError() in ProgramSaverLoader, look for "<GraphicSettings>" and "<GraphicSettings img="%">".
