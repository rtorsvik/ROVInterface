	Terje's To Do:

- Add a check to actually delete the control in GraphicToolbox.
- Make the toolbox Sliders have a label with its name and its current value, and its value while moving the slider.
- Make the FindNextAfterError() in ProgramSaverLoader, look for "<GraphicSettings img="%">".
- Make the general settings tab
	- with dll importer/ path name
	- with graphics importer/ path name
	- maybe with load settings also, which will unload everything first
